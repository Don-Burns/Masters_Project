abstract = {Ectotherms often attain smaller body sizes when they develop at higher temperatures. This phenomenon, known as the temperature–size rule, has important consequences for global fisheries, whereby ocean warming is predicted to result in smaller fish and reduced biomass. However, the generality of this phenomenon and the mechanisms that drive it in natural populations remain unresolved. In this study, we document the maximal size of 74 fish species along a steep temperature gradient in the Mediterranean Sea and find strong support for the temperature–size rule. Importantly, we additionally find that size reduction in active fish species is dramatically larger than for more sedentary species. As the temperature dependence of oxygen consumption depends on activity levels, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen is a limiting factor shaping the temperature–size rule in fishes. These results suggest that ocean warming will result in a sharp, but uneven, reduction in fish size that will cause major shifts in size-dependent interactions. Moreover, warming will have major implications for fisheries as the main species targeted for harvesting will show the most substantial declines in biomass.},

abstract = {Understanding the storage, flux, and turnover of nutrients in organisms is important for quantifying contributions of biota to biogeochemical cycles. Here we present a model that predicts the storage of phosphorus-rich RNA and whole-body phosphorus content in eukaryotes based on the mass- and temperature-dependence of ATP production in mitochondria. Data from a broad assortment of eukaryotes support the model's two main predictions. First, whole-body RNA concentration is proportional to mitochondrial density and consequently scales with body mass to the -1/4 power. Second, whole-body phosphorus content declines with increasing body mass in eukaryotic unicells but approaches a relatively constant value in large multicellular animals because the fraction of phosphorus in RNA decreases relative to the fraction in other pools. Extension of the model shows that differences in the flux of RNA-associated phosphorus are due to the size dependencies of metabolic rate and RNA concentration. Thus, the model explicitly links two biological currencies at the individual level: energy in the form of ATP and materials in the form of phosphorus, both of which are critical to the functioning of ecosystems. The model provides a framework for linking attributes of individuals to the storage and flux of phosphorus in ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We present a model, empirically grounded in data from birds and mammals, that correctly predicts how growing animals allocate food energy between synthesis of new biomass and maintenance of existing biomass. Previous energy budget models have typically had their bases in rates of either food consumption or metabolic energy expenditure. Our model provides a framework that reconciles these two approaches and highlights the fundamental principles that determine rates of food assimilation and rates of energy allocation to maintenance, biosynthesis, activity, and storage. The model predicts that growth and assimilation rates for all animals should cluster closely around two universal curves. Data for mammals and birds of diverse body sizes and taxa support these predictions.},

abstract = {Life-history trade-offs between components of fitness arise because reproduction entails both gains and costs. Costs of reproduction can be divided into ecological and physiological costs. The latter have been rarely studied yet are probably a dominant component of the effect. A deeper understanding of life-history evolution will only come about once these physiological costs are better understood. Physiological costs may be direct or indirect. Direct costs include the energy and nutrient demands of the reproductive event, and the morphological changes that are necessary to facilitate achieving these demands. Indirect costs may be optional 'compensatory costs' whereby the animal chooses to reduce investment in some other aspect of its physiology to maximize the input of resource to reproduction. Such costs may be distinguished from consequential costs that are an inescapable consequence of the reproductive event. In small mammals, the direct costs of reproduction involve increased energy, protein and calcium demands during pregnancy, but most particularly during lactation. Organ remodelling is necessary to achieve the high demands of lactation and involves growth of the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver and pancreas. Compensatory indirect costs include reductions in thermogenesis, immune function and physical activity. Obligatory consequential costs include hyperthermia, bone loss, disruption of sleep patterns and oxidative stress. This is unlikely to be a complete list. Our knowledge of these physiological costs is currently at best described as rudimentary. For some, we do not even know whether they are compensatory or obligatory. For almost all of them, we have no idea of exact mechanisms or how these costs translate into fitness trade-offs. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Stock-recruit relationships that use spawning stock biomass (SSB) to represent reproductive potential assume that the proportion of SSB composed of females and the relative fecundity (number of eggs produced per unit mass) are both constant over time. To test these two assumptions, female-only spawner biomass (FSB) and total egg production (TEP) were estimated for the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) over a 56-year time period. The proportion of females (FSB/SSB) varied between 24{\%} and 68{\%}, and the variation was systematic with length such that SSB became more female-biased as the mean length of spawners increased. Relative fecundity of the stock (TEP/SSB) varied between 115 and 355 eggs{\textperiodcentered}g-1 and was significantly, positively correlated with mean length of spawners. Both FSB and TEP gave a different interpretation of the recruitment response to reductions in stock size (overcompensatory) compared with that obtained using SSB (either compensatory or depensatory). There was no difference between SSB and FSB in the assessment of stock status; however, in recent years (1980-2001) TEP fell below the threshold level at which recruitment becomes impaired more frequently than did SSB. This suggests that using SSB as a measure of stock reproductive potential could lead to overly optimistic assessments of stock status. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.},

abstract = {For at least 200 years, since the time of Malthus, population growth has been recognized as providing a critical link between the performance of individual organisms and the ecology and evolution of species. We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth, rmax, and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population-level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual-level and population-level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why rmax exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, fishes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for rmax. The metabolic flux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates. Data for marine fishes in the field support these predictions for instantaneous rates of mortality. This theory links the rates of metabolism and resource use of individuals to life-history attributes and population dynamics for a broad assortment of organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals.},

abstract = {Trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes in ecosystems, and stability in food webs. Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 × 10 -14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Question: Proposals for measuring the shape of ageing are dimensionless comparisons of early adult mortality (Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) with aggregate mortality over the adult lifespan. What do the shape parameters actually measure? And how do they relate to the optimal age/size at maturity? Methods: Dimensional analysis is applied to an adult Gompertz mortality function, Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}c•x{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} , fitness in non-growing populations, is maximized with respect to the age at maturity, $\alpha$. Conclusions: A constant value for any 'shape of ageing' number among a collection of species implies that they also have the same value for the ratio of the two Gompertz parameters, c/Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (if mortality is Gompertz). Z0 appears in both the shape measure(s) and the formula for the optimal $\alpha$; this provides a link between the rate of ageing and the criterion for the initiation of reproductive maturation. This ESS result suggests that (perhaps) Z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, external mortality rate early in adulthood, and not any mass-specific physiological rate, should determine the ageing rate.},

abstract = {Juvenile growth curves are generally sigmoid in shape: Growth is initially nearly exponential, but it slows to near zero as the animal approaches maturity. The drop-off in growth rate is puzzling because, everything else being equal, selection favors growing as fast as possible. Existing theory posits sublinear scaling of resource acquisition with juvenile body mass and linear scaling of the requirement for maintenance, so the difference, fuel for growth, decreases as the juvenile increases in size. Experimental evidence, however, suggests that maintenance metabolism increases sublinearly not linearly with size. Here, we develop a new theory consistent with the experimental evidence. Our theory is based on the plausible assumption that there is a trade-off in the capacity of capillaries to supply growing and developed cells. As the proportion of non-growing cells increases, they take up more macromolecules from the capillaries, leaving fewer to support growing cells. The predicted growth curves are realistic and similar to those of previous models (Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and Logistic) but have the advantage of being derived from a plausible physiological model. We hope that our focus on resource delivery in capillaries will encourage new experimental work to identify the detailed physiological basis of the trade-off underlying juvenile growth curves.},

Studies on the relation of temperature to tolerance, preference, metabolic rate, performance, circulation, and growth of sockeye salmon all point to a physiological optimum in the region of 15°C. Natural occurrence is limited in time and space at temperatures above 18°C despite being able to tolerate 24°C. Forms of physiological inadequacy can be demonstrated which account for such restrictions in distribution. Predictive power for locating and accounting for concentrations of young fish in thermally stratified lakes appeared to provide "proof" for the controlling influence of the physiological optimum temperature. Early literature on the ecology of sockeye supported this view. Recent studies using midwater trawls and sonar detection reveal a diurnal behavior pattern which points to a more subtle interaction of biotic andabiotic factors governing vertical distribution in which the controlling force appears to be bioenergetic efficiency. It is concluded that a mechanism of behavioral thermoregulation has evolved which favorably balances daily metabolic expenditures in order to conserve energy when food is limited. {\textcopyright} 1971 by the American Society of Zoologists.},

Here, we derive a general mathematical model for the scaling of this activity time with body size in consumers.

These predictions are supported by a global dataset on 73 terrestrial carnivore species from 8 families spanning {\textgreater}3 orders of magnitude in size. Carnivores weighing 5 kg experience high foraging costs because their diets include significant proportions of relatively small (invertebrate) prey. As a result, they show an increase in activity time with size. This shifts to a negative scaling in larger carnivores as they shift to foraging on less costly vertebrate prey. Our model can be generalized to other classes of terrestrial and aquatic consumers and offers a general framework for mechanistically linking body size to population fitness and vulnerability in consumers.},

abstract = {Theoretical considerations suggest that the mammalian metabolic rate is linearly proportional to the surface areas of mitochondria, capillary, and alveolar membranes. However, the scaling exponents of these surface areas to the mammals' body mass (approximately 0.9-1) are higher than exponents of the resting metabolic rate (RMR) to body mass (approximately 0.75), although similar to the one of exercise metabolic rate (EMR); the underlying physiological cause of this mismatch remains unclear. The analysis presented here shows that discrepancies between the scaling exponents of RMR and the relevant surface areas may originate from, at least for the system of alveolar membranes in mammalian lungs, the facts that (i) not all of the surface area is involved in the gas exchange and (ii) that larger mammals host a smaller effective surface area that participates in the material exchange rate. A result of these facts is that lung surface areas unused at rest are activated under heavy breathing conditions (e.g., exercise), wherein larger mammals support larger activated surface areas that provide a higher capability to increase the gas-exchange rate, allowing for mammals to meet, for example, the high energetic demands of foraging and predation. {\textcopyright}2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The relative energetic investment in reproduction between the sexes forms the basis of sexual selection and life history theories in evolutionary biology. It is often assumed that males invest considerably less in gametes than females, but quantifying the energetic cost of gamete production in both sexes has remained a difficult challenge. For a broad diversity of species (invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, birds, and mammals), we compared the cost of gamete production between the sexes in terms of the investment in gonad tissue and the rate of gamete biomass production. Investment in gonad biomass was nearly proportional to body mass in both sexes, but gamete biomass production rate was approximately two to four orders of magnitude higher in females. In both males and females, gamete biomass production rate increased with organism mass as a power law, much like individual metabolic rate. This suggests that whole-organism energetics may act as a primary constraint on gamete production among species. Residual variation in sperm production rate was positively correlated with relative testes size. Together, these results suggest that understanding the heterogeneity in rates of gamete production among species requires joint consideration of the effects of gonad mass and metabolism. {\textcopyright} 2011 Hayward, Gillooly.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of temperature on biological systems, we compile, organize, and analyze a database of 1,072 thermal responses for microbes, plants, and animals. The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87{\%} are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 ± 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV.However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle - stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 ± 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},

The latter type of change is selected for detailed study, using an example found in the population resident in the western Gulf of St. Lawrence (ICNAF Division 4T). A real change in growth is verified by examining ageing methods, selectivity of sampling, tagging returns, and by measuring increments on the otoliths. Laboratory experiments showed that, when food supply is unlimited, food consumption increases with increasing temperature, and that growth increases with increasing food consumption. Direct correlation between temperature and growth changes is not established.Cod growth changes in Division 4T are found to be the result of changes in abundance and availability of herring as food, plus changes in competition for food resulting from density changes in fish-eating members of the cod population.},

abstract = {Diet restriction (DR) enhances animals' health maintenance, but refeeding reverses its beneficial effects. However, to what degree refeeding reverses the beneficial effects of DR remains controversial. Here, I develop a theoretical model for reconciling the results of refeeding studies and understanding the dynamic and reversible mechanism underlying the effects of diet on health from the energetic viewpoint. By illustrating the negative correlation between health maintenance and the energetic cost of growth in animals under different diet regimes, the model explains why, in some cases, refed animals have better health and live longer than freely fed controls. More importantly, the model reveals that, in some species, the energetic cost of synthesizing biomass increases during growth, so the expensive compensatory growth induced by refeeding later in life offsets the benefits of the inexpensive retarded growth induced by diet restriction early in life. Thus, in these species, refeeding drives animals to allocate more energy to growth and less to maintenance and therefore leads to poor health status and shorter life span compared to freely fed controls. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {The growth and reproductive schedule of terrestrial plants can be usefully studied as the dynamic optimal allocation of material between different organs. This idea, pioneered by Dan Cohen, has been formalized as an optimal control problem and analysed using Pontryagin's maximum principle or dynamic programming. Here, I review several examples of dynamic resource allocation models. First, the seasonal timing of reproduction of annuals is discussed. This can be extended to plants with multiple vegetative organs and the optimal shoot-root balance is assessed. Secondly, the growth schedule over multiple seasons is examined, and the reproductive effort, the leaf phenology of deciduous perennials, and the conditions under which perenniality is more advantageous than annuality are considered. With some modifications, the same model can handle intermittent reproduction and monocarpic perennials (one large reproduction after many years). Thirdly, growth in an unpredictably fluctuating environment is analysed for the case in which a sudden disturbance (herbivory or fire) removes the photosynthetic system altogether, followed by recovery using stored material, and for the case in which environmental productivity fluctuates in a Markovian process. Finally, the optimal level of chemical defence against herbivory is formalized and used to explain the intensity of alkaloid defence decreasing with leaf age. These examples illustrate the usefulness of dynamic resource allocation models in understanding plant life-history adaptation.},

abstract = {Dietary restriction (DR) is currently the only paradigm that has consistently extended maximal life span and reduced the onset of age-related chronic diseases in all of the nonprimate species tested. Although it is controversial, some investigators have suggested that the underlying mechanisms may be mediated by adaptations in energy expenditure. We evaluated the extent to which DR alters energy metabolism in a unique cohort of rhesus monkeys submitted to DR for 11 yr. Total energy expenditure (doubly labeled water), resting energy expenditure (REE; indirect calorimetry), and nonbasal energy expenditure (calculated by difference) were measured in DR (n = 12) and control (n = 11) animals. Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Both fat mass and fat-free mass were lower in the restricted animals (56 and 12{\%}, respectively). DR induced a 17{\%} lower total energy expenditure that was attributable to a 20{\%} decrease in REE without changes in the nonbasal energy expenditure. Adjusted for fat-free mass, REE was 13{\%} lower with DR (-250 kJ/d). Taken together with a reanalysis of previous DR experiments published in humans, rodents, and monkeys, these results suggest that DR may lower REE independent of the DR-induced changes in body composition. Whether this reduction in REE contributes to the life-extending properties of DR warrants further analysis, but it suggests that the longstanding debate regarding DR effects on metabolic rates may derive from the lack of consensus on how to adjust for body size and composition.},

The phenomenology developed here has the convenient property that only parameters describing the shapes of two assumed trade-offs among life history traits appear in the solution of the resulting optimisation problem.

Standard and routine metabolic rates increased linearly with body mass (range 0.9-8.4 g) when plotted on a doubly logarithmic scale (linear regression equations: standard metabolic rate: log individual oxygen consumption rate = 0.65 + 0.86 log body mass; routine metabolic rate: log individual oxygen consumption rate = 0.75 + 0.86 log body mass). Routine metabolic rates were, on average, 30{\%} higher than standard metabolic rates. Submissive and agonistic behaviours raised routine metabolic rates by factors of 3.3 and 3.9, respectively. Digging resulted in a 6.1-fold increase of routine metabolic rates. Differences in metabolic rates between active and resting rates were statistically significant. However, those between the three behaviours were not. Mean opercular beat frequencies correlated significantly with routine metabolic rates and with metabolic rates when performing specific behaviours, which offers methodological prospects for field measurements. In N. pulcher, the high energy expenditure for submissive behaviour may indicate that this is a reliable signal. The considerable energy expenditure involved in territory defence suggests that these costs should be considered in addition to risk in cost-benefit analyses. This is the first study in which the energy expenditures of specific social and territory maintenance behaviours of individual fish were measured directly by respirometry and within the usual social setting of the fish.},

Respirometric and metabolic changes in A. ocellatus were studied during exposure to stepwise declining oxygen levels. Respiration rates were continuously recorded. Haematologic and metabolic parameters (lactate, glucose, cortisol and free fatty acids (FFA)) were determined. A. ocellatus was found to be hypoxia tolerant; it survives more than 16 h of severe hypoxia (pO2≤0.4 mg l−1) and even 4 h of complete anoxia at 28°C. Its routine metabolic rate is 10.8 mg O2 h−1 per 100 g fresh weight. A significant decrease in standard metabolic rate (SMR) starts at 20{\%} air saturation, whereas a significant change of blood lactate does not start until 6{\%} air saturation in water.

This model assumes that there is a fixed amount of surplus energy which may be channeled into either somatic or gonadal tissue. The change in weight or length of a fish can be predicted from this model from the surplus energy and the gonadosomatic index. In many species the gonadosomatic index can be assumed to be a constant. Surplus energy can be estimated by inverting the growth equations. It is thereby possible to examine the consequences on Darwinian fitness of changes in the age at maturity or the allocation to reproduction as measured by changes in the gonadosomatic index. The allocation model is validated using data on growth of American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides.

abstract = {For at least 200 years, since the time of Malthus, population growth has been recognized as providing a critical link between the performance of individual organisms and the ecology and evolution of species. We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth, rmax, and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population-level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual-level and population-level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why rmax exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, fishes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for rmax. The metabolic flux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates. Data for marine fishes in the field support these predictions for instantaneous rates of mortality. This theory links the rates of metabolism and resource use of individuals to life-history attributes and population dynamics for a broad assortment of organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals.},

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon is important to conceptual problems in life-history theory, as well as to applied problems in animal husbandry and biomedicine. Despite a considerable amount of empirical data published since the 1930s, there is no relevant general theoretical framework that predicts how animals vary their energy budgets and life-history traits under FR. In this paper, we develop such a general quantitative model based on fundamental principles of metabolic energy allocation during ontogeny. This model predicts growth curves under varying conditions of FR, such as the compensatory growth, different age at which FR begins, its degree and its duration. Our model gives a quantitative explanation for the counterintuitive phenomenon that under FR, lower body temperature and lower metabolism lead to faster growth and larger adult size. This model also predicts that the animals experiencing FR reach the same fraction of their adult mass at the same age as their ad libitum counterparts. All predictions are well supported by empirical data from mammals and birds of varying body size, under different conditions of FR. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Observations that rates of molecular evolution vary widely within and among lineages have cast doubts on the existence of a single "molecular clock." Differences in the timing of evolutionary events estimated from genetic and fossil evidence have raised further questions about the accuracy of molecular clocks. Here, we present a model of nucleotide substitution that combines theory on metabolic rate with the now-classic neutral theory of molecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity and may reconcile differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionary events. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperature on metabolic rate, this model explains heterogeneity in rates of nucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments. This model also suggests that there is indeed a single molecular clock, as originally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling [Zuckerkandl, E. {\&} Pauling, L. (1965) in Evolving Genes and Proteins, eds. Bryson, V. {\&} Vogel, H. J. (Academic, New York), pp. 97-166], but that it "ticks" at a constant substitution rate per unit of mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit of time. This model therefore links energy flux and genetic change. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combine to control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.},

abstract = {Trade-offs in energy allocation between growth, reproduction, and survival are at the core of life-history theory. While age-specific mortality is considered to be the main determinant of the optimal allocation, some life-history strategies, such as delayed or skipped reproduction, may be better understood when also accounting for reproduction costs. Here, we present a two-pool indeterminate grower model that includes survival and energetic costs of reproduction. The energetic cost sets a minimum reserve required for reproduction, while the survival cost reflects increased mortality from low postreproduc-tive body condition. Three life-history parameters determining age-dependent energy allocation to soma, reserve, and reproduction are optimized, and we show that the optimal strategies can reproduce realistic emergent growth trajectories, maturation ages, and reproductive outputs for fish. The model predicts maturation phase shifts along the gradient of condition-related mortality and shows that increased harvesting will select for earlier maturation and higher energy allocation to reproduction. However, since the energetic reproduction cost sets limits on how early an individual can mature, an increase in fitness at high harvesting can only be achieved by diverting most reserves into reproduction. The model presented here can improve predictions of life-history responses to environmental change and human impacts because key life-history traits such as maturation age and size, maximum body size, and size-specific fecundity emerge dynamically.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that in teleosts there is a significant correlation between the life history parameters, age at first reproduction, natural mortality, and growth rate. In this paper 1 hypothesize that these correlations are the result of evolutionary adjustments due to the trade-off between reproduction, growth, and survival. A simple and reasonable assumption is that the costs of reproduction are sufficient to cause the ltmt function to decrease. A simple expression relating the age at first reproduction is derived from this assumption. This formula accounts for a statistically significant portion (60.6{\%}) of the variation in age at first reproduction in 30 stocks of fish. To extend the model to predict the distribution of life history parameters across all teleosts, an explicit cost function is incorporated. The model is analyzed with respect to two fitness measures, the expected lifetime fecundity and malthusian parameter, r. In the first case it is shown that the optimal age at maturity, T, depends only on the natural mortality rate (M) and the growth rate (k). In the second case,T is a function of k and the logarithm of a parameter, In C; the latter is a product of egg and larval survival, maximum body length (Lx), and the proportionality coefficient of the fecundity/length function. Difficulties of measuring egg and larval survival make the testing of the latter case difficult for particular species. However, this method provides a simple formula for the computation of r; this is shown generally to be approximately zero, thereby adding strength to the assumptions of the first analysis. The distribution patterns of T on k and M on k are predicted and compared with the observed pattern. In general, the predictions are validated: however, certain combinations of k and lnC are shown to occur very infrequently. The prediction of such "empty" regions of the parameter space remains a challenge for future development of life history theory.},

abstract = {Many ectotherms show crossing growth trajectories as a plastic response to rearing temperature. As a result, individuals growing up in cool conditions grow slower, mature later, but are larger at maturation than those growing up in warm conditions. To date, no entirely satisfactory explanation has been found for why this pattern, often called the temperature-size rule, should exist. Previous theoretical models have assumed that size-specific mortality rates were most likely to drive the pattern. Here, I extend one theoretical model to show that variation in size-fecundity relationships may also be important. Plasticity in the size-fecundity relationship has rarely been considered, but a number of studies show that fecundity increases more quickly with size in cold environments than it does in warm environments. The greater increase in fecundity offsets costs of delayed maturation in cold environments, favoring a larger size at maturation. This can explain many cases of crossing growth trajectories, not just in relation to temperature. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).

abstract = {The value of big old fat fecund female fish (BOFFFFs) in fostering stock productivity and stability has long been underappreciated by conventional fisheries science and management, although Hjort (1914) indirectly alluded to the importance of maternal effects. Compared with smaller mature females, BOFFFFs in a broad variety of marine and freshwater teleosts produce far more and often larger eggs that may develop into larvae that grow faster and withstand starvation better. As (if not more) importantly, BOFFFFs in batch-spawning species tend to have earlier and longer spawning seasons and may spawn in different locations than smaller females. Such features indicate that BOFFFFs are major agents of bet-hedging strategies that help to ensure individual reproductive success in environments that vary tremendously in time and space. Even if all else were equal, BOFFFFs can outlive periods that are unfavourable for successful reproduction and be ready to spawn profusely and enhance recruitment when favourable conditions return (the storage effect). Fishing differentially removes BOFFFFs, typically resulting in severe truncation of the size and age structure of the population. In the worst cases, fishing mortality acts as a powerful selective agent that inhibits reversal of size and age truncation, even if fishing intensity is later reduced. Age truncation is now known to destabilize fished populations, increasing their susceptibility to collapse. Although some fisheries models are beginning to incorporate maternal and other old-growth effects, most continue to treat all spawning-stock biomass as identical: many small young females are assumed to contribute the same to stock productivity as an equivalent mass of BOFFFFs. A growing body of knowledge dictates that fisheries productivity and stability would be enhanced if management conserved old-growth age structure in fished stocks, be it by limiting exploitation rates, by implementing slot limits, or by establishing marine reserves, which are now known to seed surrounding fished areas via larval dispersal. Networks of marine reserves are likely to be the most effective means of ensuring that pockets of old-growth age structure survive throughout the geographic range of demersal species.},

Here we use a first-principles theoretical model to characterise the energetics of fish growth at distinct ontogenetic stages and in distinct thermal regimes. Empirically, we show that the mass scaling of growth rates follows that of metabolic rate, and is somewhat steeper at earlier ontogenetic stages. We also demonstrate that the cost of growth, Em, varies substantially among fishes, and that it may increase with temperature, trophic level and level of activity. Theoretically, we show that Em is a primary determinant of the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels, and that energy is transferred more efficiently between trophic levels if the prey are young and sedentary. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of characterising the energetics of individual growth in order to understand constraints on the structure of food webs and ecosystems.},

abstract = {The reliance of the aquafeed industry on marine resources has to be reduced by innovative approaches in fish nutrition. Thus, a three-factorial approach (fish oil reduced diet, phytochemical genistein, and temperature reduction) was chosen to investigate the interaction of effects on growth performance and tissue omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) levels in juvenile sea bream (Sparus aurata, 12.5 ± 2.2 g). Genistein is a phytoestrogen with estrogen-like activity and thus LC-PUFA increasing potential. A decrease in the rearing temperature was chosen based on the positive effects of low temperature on fish lipid quality. The experimental diets were reduced in marine ingredients and had a fish oil content of either 6{\%} dry matter (DM; F6: positive control) or 2{\%} DM (F2: negative control) and were administered in the plain variant or with inclusion of 0.15{\%} DM genistein (F6 + G and F2 + G). The feeding trial was performed simultaneously at 23C and 19C. The results indicated that solely temperature had a significant effect on growth performance and whole body nutrient composition of sea bream. Nevertheless, the interaction of all three factors significantly affected the fatty acid compositions of liver and fillet tissue. Most importantly, they led to a significant increase by 4.3{\%} of fillet LC-PUFA content in sea bream fed with the diet F6 + G in comparison to control fish fed diet F6, when both groups were held at 19C. It is hypothesized that genistein can act via estrogen-like as well as other mechanisms and that the dietary LC-PUFA content may impact its mode of action. Temperature most likely exhibited its effects indirectly via altered growth rates and metabolism. Although effects of all three factors and of genistein in particular were only marginal, they highlight a possibility to utilize the genetic capacity of sea bream to improve tissue lipid quality.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of the response of metabolic rate to temperature is essential for understanding thermal ecology and metabolic adaptation. Although the Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the effects of temperature on reaction rates and metabolic traits, it does not adequately describe two aspects of the thermal performance curve (TPC) for metabolic rate—that metabolic rate is a unimodal function of temperature often with maximal values in the biologically relevant temperature range and that activation energies are temperature dependent. We show that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate in ectotherms is well described by an enzyme-assisted Arrhenius (EAAR) model that accounts for the temperature-dependent contribution of enzymes to decreasing the activation energy required for reactions to occur. The model is mechanistically derived using the thermodynamic rules that govern protein stability. We contrast our model with other unimodal functions that also can be used to describe the temperature dependence of metabolic rate to show how the EAAR model provides an important advance over previous work. We fit the EAAR model to metabolic rate data for a variety of taxa to demonstrate the model's utility in describing metabolic rate TPCs while revealing significant differences in thermodynamic properties across species and acclimation temperatures. Our model advances our ability to understand the metabolic and ecological consequences of increases in the mean and variance of temperature associated with global climate change. In addition, the model suggests avenues by which organisms can acclimate and adapt to changing thermal environments. Furthermore, the parameters in the EAAR model generate links between organismal level performance and underlying molecular processes that can be tested for in future work.},

abstract = {The size and metabolic rate of cells affect processes from the molecular to the organismal level. We present a quantitative, theoretical framework for studying relationships among cell volume, cellular metabolic rate, body size, and whole-organism metabolic rate that helps reveal the feedback between these levels of organization. We use this framework to show that average cell volume and average cellular metabolic rate cannot both remain constant with changes in body size because of the well known body-size dependence of whole-organism metabolic rate. Based on empirical data compiled for 18 cell types in mammals, we find that many cell types, including erythrocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, follow a strategy in which cellular metabolic rate is body size dependent and cell volume is body size invariant. We suggest that this scaling holds for all quickly dividing cells, and conversely, that slowly dividing cells are expected to follow a strategy in which cell volume is body size dependent and cellular metabolic rate is roughly invariant with body size. Data for slowly dividing neurons and adipocytes show that cell volume does indeed scale with body size. From these results, we argue that the particular strategy followed depends on the structural and functional properties of the cell type. We also discuss consequences of these two strategies for cell number and capillary densities. Our results and conceptual framework emphasize fundamental constraints that link the structure and function of cells to that of whole organisms. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {In a stable population, the adult lifetime reproductive value must be balanced against early life survival. Although delaying maturity may increase fecundity, it also reduces survival. Larger size at maturity therefore not only allows for higher fecundity, but requires it. Using simple arguments from life history, we derive a direct proportionality relationship between the adult lifetime reproductive value and weight at maturation and find that this relationship is consistent with empirical evidence from 28 stocks and species of bony fish from temperate-boreal environments. However, the expected proportionality falls off if mortality increases to include fishing. Furthermore, we find that the fecundity type (determinate or indeterminate) affects the predicted adult reproductive value, which is significantly (10-fold) higher for an indeterminate spawner than for a determinate spawner of the same weight. These differences may relate to trade-offs in the adult life history traits and (or) to seasonality in the spawning environment, with subsequent consequences for early life stage survivorship.},

Using experiments with the green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, we apply the model to show that the temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency is key to understanding responses of growth rates to warming at both ecological and longer-term evolutionary timescales. Finally, we assemble a dataset of multiple terrestrial and aquatic autotroph species to show that the effects of temperature-dependent carbon allocation efficiency on potential growth rate TPCs are expected to be consistent across taxa. In particular, both the thermal sensitivity and the optimal temperature of growth rates are expected to change significantly due to temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency alone.

With continued business-as-usual emissions, mean sea-surface temperatures within MPAs are projected to increase 0.035 °C per year and warm an additional 2.8 °C by 2100. Under these conditions, the time of emergence (the year when sea-surface temperature and oxygen concentration exceed natural variability) is mid-century in 42{\%} of 309 no-take marine reserves. Moreover, projected warming rates and the existing 'community thermal safety margin' (the inherent buffer against warming based on the thermal sensitivity of constituent species) both vary among ecoregions and with latitude. The community thermal safety margin will be exceeded by 2050 in the tropics and by 2150 for many higher latitude MPAs. Importantly, the spatial distribution of emergence is stressor-specific. Hence, rearranging MPAs to minimize exposure to one stressor could well increase exposure to another. Continued business-as-usual emissions will likely disrupt many marine ecosystems, reducing the benefits of MPAs.},

The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. 3. The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0-30°C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. 4. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0-30°C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. 5.

abstract = {Genetically based variation in metabolic rates of resting animals (RMR) suggests a potential role for evolutionary adaptations, but mechanistic models yielding evolutionary predictions are lacking. Here I utilize the increasingly recognized genetic correlation between RMR and activity metabolism and propose that optimality of the former is simply an outcome of selection on the latter. I develop a model for temporally stable environmental conditions that describes how the rate of acquisition of energy that can be converted into somatic growth and reproductive output can be expressed as a function of activity metabolism. One of the parameters in the model describes how food intake depends on activity and is hence a measure of food abundance. In contrast to the previously proposed hypothesis that individuals with a high RMR are at an advantage when environmental conditions are favorable, the model predicts that the optimal RMR is highest at an intermediate food abundance. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {In nature under adverse conditions like low oxygen conditions or starvation fish often lower their metabolism: 'metabolic depression'. This strategy of lowering the metabolic rate is a survival strategy and is used to save energy stores and diminish end-product accumulation. The overall metabolic rate of animals can be deduced by measuring metabolic processes such as oxygen consumption, but the ultimate method is measuring heat flow. In this review, we will summarise the available data about metabolic depression measuring heat flow, i.e. by direct calorimetry in fishes, which were carried out almost exclusively with a 1-l flow through calorimeter. Using deconvolution techniques the time constant of this calorimeter was measured that allowed to estimate the time course of metabolic depression, which was found to take place on a time scale of 20-30 min. We demonstrated that metabolic depression is species dependent. Goldfish, eel and tilapia show metabolic depression under low oxygen conditions while this is not the case for common carp. In addition it is shown that metabolic depression is flexible and increases with decreasing oxygen availability. Furthermore using a video analysing system we demonstrated that metabolic depression is not caused by a reduction of external activity. As heart rate falls dramatically during metabolic depression as shown by small wireless transmitters, we hypothesise that blood flow reduction might be the proximate cause for metabolic depression. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding energy and material fluxes through ecosystems is central to many questions in global change biology and ecology. Ecosystem respiration is a critical component of the carbon cycle and might be important in regulating biosphere response to global climate change. Here we derive a general model of ecosystem respiration based on the kinetics of metabolic reactions and the scaling of resource use by individual organisms. The model predicts that fluxes of CO2 and energy are invariant of ecosystem biomass, but are strongly influenced by temperature, variation in cellular metabolism and rates of supply of limiting resources (water and/or nutrients). Variation in ecosystem respiration within sites, as calculated from a network of CO2 flux towers, provides robust support for the model's predictions. However, data indicate that variation in annual flux between sites is not strongly dependent on average site temperature or latitude. This presents an interesting paradox with regard to the expected temperature dependence. Nevertheless, our model provides a basis for quantitatively understanding energy and material flux between the atmosphere and biosphere.},

We compiled a dataset on the temperature dependence of metabolic rate for heterotrophic ectotherms from studies that show a peak in metabolic rate at an optimal temperature (i.e. that describe the thermal performance curve for metabolic rate). We found that peak metabolic rates were lower in aquatic than terrestrial habitats and increased with body mass, latitude and the optimal temperature. In addition, the optimal temperature decreased with latitude. These results support competing hypotheses about metabolic rate adaptation, with hotter being better in the tropics but colder being better towards the poles. Moreover, our results suggest that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate is more complex than previously suggested.},

abstract = {The influence of food deprivation on the rate of oxygen consumption and the rate of mobilization/utilization of energy reserves in F2 generation growth-enhanced transgenic Atlantic salmon were compared relative to their non-transgenic counterparts, over a pre-smolt weight interval of 8 to 55 g. Throughout most of the 8 weeks of food deprivation, transgenic fish exhibited a greater rate of oxygen consumption compared to control salmon, but also exhibited a more rapid decline in oxygen consumption as starvation progressed. Consequently, depending on initial weight and length of food deprivation, the rate of oxygen consumption of transgenic fish declined to where it equaled or was less than the oxygen consumption of control fish. Transgenic fish depleted body protein, dry matter, lipid and energy at a faster rate than did the controls. Additionally, in both groups, lipid was catabolized faster than was protein. Although transgenic fish demonstrated the ability to reduce their metabolic rate during starvation, as also observed in the non-genetically modified control salmon, their persistence in maintaining a higher metabolic rate, combined with their lower initial endogenous energy reserves, suggests that the likelihood of growth-enhanced transgenic salmon achieving maximum growth or even surviving outside intensive culture conditions may be lower than that of non-transgenic salmon.

abstract = {The carbon cycle modulates climate change via the regulation of atmospheric CO2, and represents one of the most important ecosystem services of value to humans. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedbacks between the biota and the climate. We developed theoretical models derived from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), and tested them in an ecosystem-level manipulative experiment in freshwater mesocosms. The year-long experiment simulated a warming scenario (A1B; [IPCC, 2007]) expected by the end of the century. The key components of the carbon cycle - that is gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 efflux (ME) - measured in our experiment were all strongly related to temperature. Their temperature dependence was typically constrained by the average activation energy of their particular metabolic pathway, and as predicted by our models, this increased progressively for GPP, ER and ME. Warming of 4 C decreased the sequestration of CO2 by 13{\%}, increased the fraction of primary production effluxing as methane by 20{\%} and the fraction of ER as methane by 9{\%}, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because methane has 21 times the greenhouse gas radiative potential of CO2, these results suggest aquatic ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle. We then used a series of global data compilations of measurements of rates of primary production and respiration to better understand the temperature dependence of the carbon cycle in other aquatic ecosystems and to compare them with data from terrestrial systems. Our experimental results were mirrored by our global data compilations, with the effective activation energy for marine and freshwater primary production identical to GPP measured in our experiment. Similarly, the temperature dependences of respiration in estuaries, lakes and the ocean were indistinguishable from that of ER in our experiment. Finally, our study suggests that the temperature dependence of primary production and respiration in aquatic ecosystems might differ from those in terrestrial ecosystems, and this could be crucial in predicting the future response of the carbon cycle in these different systems to global warming. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The cuttlefish Sepia apama Gray (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) is a seasonally abundant food resource exploited annually by moulting albatrosses throughout winter and early spring in the coastal waters of New South Wales, Australia. To assess its nutritional value as albatross forage, we analysed S. apama for water, lipid protein, ash contents, energy density and amino acid composition. Because albatrosses consistently consume S. apama parts preferentially in the order of head, viscera and mantle, we analysed these sections separately, but did not identify any nutritional basis for this selective feeding behaviour. The gross energy value of S. apama bodies was 20.9 kJ/g dry mass, but their high water content ({\textgreater}83{\%}; cf {\textless}70{\%} for fish) results in a relatively low energy density of 3.53 kJ/g. This may contribute to a need to take large meals, which subsequently degrade flight performance. Protein content was typically {\textgreater}75{\%} dry mass, whereas fat content was only about 1{\%}. Albatrosses feed on many species of cephalopods and teleost fish, and we found the amino acid composition of S. apama to be comparable to a range of species within these taxa. We used S. apama exclusively in feeding trials to estimate the energy assimilation efficiency for Diomedea albatrosses. We estimated their nitrogen-corrected apparent energy assimilation efficiency for consuming this prey to be 81.82 ± 0.72{\%} and nitrogen retention as 2.90 ± 0.11 g N kg-1d-1. Although S. apama has a high water content and relatively low energy density, its protein composition is otherwise comparable to other albatross prey species. Consequently, the large size and seasonal abundance of this prey should ensure that albatrosses remain replete and adequately nourished on this forage while undergoing moult. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {There is currently unprecedented interest in quantifying variation in thermal physiology among organisms, especially in order to understand and predict the biological impacts of climate change. A key parameter in this quantification of thermal physiology is the performance or value of a rate, across individuals or species, at a common temperature (temperature normalisation). An increasingly popular model for fitting thermal performance curves to data-the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation-can yield strongly inflated estimates of temperature-normalised rate values. These deviations occur whenever a key thermodynamic assumption of the model is violated, i.e., when the enzyme governing the performance of the rate is not fully functional at the chosen reference temperature. Using data on 1,758 thermal performance curves across a wide range of species, we identify the conditions that exacerbate this inflation. We then demonstrate that these biases can compromise tests to detect metabolic cold adaptation, which requires comparison of fitness or rate performance of different species or genotypes at some fixed low temperature. Finally, we suggest alternative methods for obtaining unbiased estimates of temperature-normalised rate values for meta-analyses of thermal performance across species in climate change impact studies.},

The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87{\%} are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 ± 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV.However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle - stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 ± 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},

abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to reevaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data syntheses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools.},

abstract = {Understanding the trade-offs between organisms' life history traits has been a major goal of physiology, ecology and evolution. In the last few decades, two types of intra-specific studies have highlighted the trade-off between growth and longevity. First, diet restriction (DR), as an environmental intervention, has been shown to suppress growth and extend the lifespan of a broad range of animals. Second, genetic studies have also shown that mice, whose growth hormone function is genetically modified (GM), grow slower and live longer than their wild-type siblings. Despite a wealth of empirical data, still largely missing is a theoretical framework that specifies and makes quantitative predictions on this trade-off. Here, I present a mechanistic model based on the principles of energy conservation. The model quantifies explicitly how DR and GM alter the animal's energy budget, and channel metabolic energy to somatic maintenance by suppressing growth, thereby extending lifespan. Data from a diverse set of empirical studies on small rodents supports the predictions of the model. More importantly, the model reveals that although DR and GM are two different methods to extend lifespan, i.e., environmental vs. genetic, the underlying mechanisms of them are the same from the energetic viewpoint. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {1. We examined published studies relating resting oxygen consumption to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40°C. 2. Resting metabolic rate (R(b); mmol oxygen gas h-1) was related to body mass (M; wet mass, g) by R(b) = aMb, where a is a constant and b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species was 0.79 (SE 0.11). The general equation for all teleost fish was lnR(b) = 0.80(lnM) - 5.43. 3. The relationship between resting oxygen consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear. A typical tropical fish at 30°C requires approximately six times as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0°C. This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models, of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was lnR(b) = 15.7-5.02. T-1, where T is absolute temperature (103 x K). 4. The Arrhenius model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism (mean Q10 = 1.83 over the range 0-30°C) than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q10 = 2.40, n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species. Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar slopes but significantly different mean rates. 5. Analysis of the data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation (the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher than predicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established for temperate and tropical species). 6. Taxonomic variation in mean resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge of fish evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Ecosystem respiration is the biotic conversion of organic carbon to carbon dioxide by all of the organisms in an ecosystem, including both consumers and primary producers. Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels, but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables including community abundance and biomass, which vary substantially among ecosystems. Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model derived from metabolic theory, these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the importance of other variables besides temperature-such as primary productivity and allochthonous carbon inputs-on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Senescence in wild populations was long considered negligible but current evidence suggests that it is widespread in natural populations of mammals and birds, affecting the survival and reproductive output of older individuals. In contrast, little is known about reproductive senescence in species with asymptotic growth that can keep increasing their reproductive output as they grow older and larger. Using a cross-sectional study, we tested age-related decline in fecundity and relative allocation to reproduction in five wild populations of an annual killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri (Cyprinodontiformes). We did not detect any decline in absolute female egg production over their short lifespan in the wild. Relative fecundity (egg production controlled for female body mass) tended to decrease with age. This effect was driven primarily by a single population that survived 17 weeks, almost twice as long as the median persistence of the other four study populations. There was no decrease in relative ovary mass while in males, relative testes mass actually increased with age. Intra-population variation in relative ovary mass increased in older females suggesting heterogeneity in individual trajectories of female reproductive allocation. Overall, we demonstrate that annual killifish do not experience significant age-related decline in reproductive functions during their very short lifespan in the wild despite the marked deterioration of gonad tissue detected in captivity.},

abstract = {Senescence is the physiological deterioration of adult organisms leading to an age-specific decline in fitness principally associated with an increase in mortality rate (actuarial senescence) and decline in fecundity (reproductive senescence). Senescence is common in natural populations of many taxa; however, there are few examples among fishes, even though they are the most speciose vertebrates and comprise a disproportionate number of long-lived animal species. A notable example in fish is Nor wegian spring-spawning Atlantic herring Clupea har engus, which experiences actuarial senescence. Given expected associations between actuarial and reproductive senescence, Atlantic herring likely also experience reproductive senescence. We examined biological data obtained over 4 decades for 15 Canadian Atlantic herring stocks for evidence of reproductive senescence. Age- and length-specific increases in the relative frequency of morphologically non-reproductive herring and age-related decreases in reproductive investment were consistent with reproductive senescence in both sexes, combined with a post-reproductive increase in growth rate. Available evidence was not consistent with 2 alternative hypotheses: delayed maturation combined with higher survival for late-maturing fish, or an increasing frequency of skipped spawning with age. Although the incidence of post-reproductive herring was generally low, this was likely because very few individuals survive to older ages due to fishing. The present study presents the first strong example of reproductive senescence in a marine fish, notably one that is both ecologically important and a target of large fisheries throughout its range.},

Eggs spawned in either manner are fertilized, but widely scattered eggs receive no parental care, whereas eggs spawned into nests are usually guarded by the male until they hatch. Here, I report weight changes of individual marked fish that engaged in a variety of different reproductive behaviors during three breeding seasons. Males gained weight at 0.15{\%} per day outside the spawning season, and added 29-78{\%} to their overall body weight between reproductive seasons, even following substantive weight losses in a spawning season (up to 20{\%} among nesting males). Nesting and nest-guarding males lost an average of 0.32{\%} and 0.41{\%} of their body weight per day in 1986 and 1987. This cost is four times greater than reproduction for nonnesting males, which registered a 0.03{\%} daily weight gain. Actively spawning females lost 0.06{\%} of their body weight daily during the spawning season. While long-term growth rates did not appear to be substantially affected by reproduction in either sex or by parental care in males, present work does not exclude the possibility that such long-term effects may exist. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

Two major branches of theory (mechanistic and phenomenological) describe the dynamics of growth and explain variation in the size of organisms. Both theory branches usually assume that reproductive output scales proportionately with body size, in other words that reproductive output is isometric. A meta-analysis of hundreds of marine fishes contradicts this assumption, larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more in 95{\%} of species studied, and patterns in other taxa suggest that reproductive hyperallometry is widespread. We argue here that reproductive hyperallometry represents a profound challenge to mechanistic theories of growth in particular, and that they should be revised accordingly. We suspect that hyperallometric reproduction drives growth trajectories in ways that are largely unanticipated by current theories.},

Can fisheries-induced evolution shift reference points for fisheries management? – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 707–721. Biological reference points are important tools for fisheries management. Reference points are not static, but may change when a population's environment or the population itself changes. Fisheries-induced evolution is one mechanism that can alter population characteristics, leading to “shifting” reference points by modifying the underlying biological processes or by changing the perception of a fishery system. The former causes changes in “true” reference points, whereas the latter is caused by changes in the yardsticks used to quantify a system's status. Unaccounted shifts of either kind imply that reference points gradually lose their intended meaning. This can lead to increased precaution, which is safe, but potentially costly. Shifts can also occur in more perilous directions, such that actual risks are greater than anticipated. Our qualitative analysis suggests that all commonly used reference points are susceptible to shifting through fisheries-induced evolution, including the limit and “precautionary” reference points for spawning-stock biomass, Blim and Bpa, and the target reference point for fishing mortality, F0.1. Our findings call for increased awareness of fisheries-induced changes and highlight the value of always basing reference points on adequately updated information, to capture all changes in the biological processes that drive fish population dynamics.},

abstract = {In a 1966 American Naturalist article, G. C. Williams initiated the study of reproductive effort (RE) with the prediction that longer-lived organisms ought to expend less in reproduction per unit of time. We can multiply RE, often measured in fractions of adult body mass committed to reproduction per unit time, by the average adult life span to get lifetime reproductive effort (LRE). Williams's hypothesis (across species, RE decreases as life span increases) can then be refined to read "LRE will be approximately constant for similar organisms." Here we show that LRE is a key component of fitness in nongrowing populations, and thus its value is central to understanding life-history evolution. We then develop metabolic life-history theory to predict that LRE ought to be approximately 1.4 across organisms despite extreme differences in production and growth rates. We estimate LRE for mammals and lizards that differ in growth and production by five- to tenfold. The distributions are approximately normal with means of 1.43 and 1.41 for lizards and mammals, respectively (95{\%} confidence intervals: 1.3-1.5 and 1.2-1.6). Ultimately, therefore, a female can only produce a mass of offspring approximately equal to 1.4 times her own body mass during the course of her life. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Maximal metabolic rate (MMR) of mammals scales differently from basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is first shown by scrutinizing data reported on exercise-induced V̇O2max in 34 eutherian mammalian species covering a body mass range of 7 g-500 kg. V̇O2max was found to scale with the 0.872 (±0.029, 95{\%} confidence limits 0.813-0.932) power of body mass which is significantly different from the 3/4 power reported for basal metabolic rate. The aerobic scope is higher in athletic than non-athletic species, and it is also higher in large than in small species. Integrated structure-function studies on a subset of 11 species (body mass 20 g-450 kg) show that the variation of V̇O2max with body size is tightly associated with the aerobic capacity of the locomotor musculature: the scaling exponents for V̇O2max, the total volume of mitochondria, and the volume of capillaries are nearly identical. The higher V̇O2max of athletic species is tightly linked to proportionally larger mitochondrial and capillary volumes in animals of the same size class. As a result V̇O2max is linearly related to both total mitochondrial and capillary erythrocyte volumes. We conclude that the scaling of maximal metabolic rate is explained by features and mechanisms different from those determining basal metabolic rate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The goodness of fit is generally excellent, including embryo development (embryo weight, respiration, amount of yolk).

Five different types of acceleration are identified, examples are given, and methods are presented to recognise these different types.

abstract = {Whether the thermal sensitivity of an organism's traits follows the simple Boltzmann-Arrhenius model remains a contentious issue that centers around consideration of its operational temperature range and whether the sensitivity corresponds to one or a few underlying rate-limiting enzymes. Resolving this issue is crucial, because mechanistic models for temperature dependence of traits are required to predict the biological effects of climate change. Here, by combining theory with data on 1,085 thermal responses from a wide range of traits and organisms, we show that substantial variation in thermal sensitivity (activation energy) estimates can arise simply because of variation in the range of measured temperatures. Furthermore, when thermal responses deviate systematically from the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model, variation in measured temperature ranges across studies can bias estimated activation energy distributions toward higher mean, median, variance, and skewness. Remarkably, this bias alone can yield activation energies that encompass the range expected from biochemical reactions (from ∼0.2 to 1.2 eV), making it difficult to establish whether a single activation energy appropriately captures thermal sensitivity. We provide guidelines and a simple equation for partially correcting for such artifacts. Our results have important implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of thermal responses of biological traits and for accurately modeling effects of variation in thermal sensitivity on responses of individuals, populations, and ecological communities to changing climatic temperatures.},

The design is a solution to an ecological problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic to the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of phenotypes in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions from genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected to fitness. Among the questions answered are the following: Why are organisms small or large? Why do they mature early or late? Why do they have few or many offspring? Why do they have a short or a long life? Why must they grow old and die? The classical approach to life histories was optimization; it has had some convincing empirical success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and explicit population dynamics have supplanted optimization as the preferred approach. They have not yet had as much empirical success, but there are logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend the impact of life history theory into population dynamics and inter-specific interactions in coevolving communities.},

abstract = {The size-dependence of some 20 physiological variables has been derived from a rather simple model for energy budgets. This nine parameter model is based on detailed observations on the growth and reproduction at varying food densities, and has the state variables size and storage. The size-dependence of some variables works out to be different for animals of the same species as opposed to animals of different species. The reproductive rate, for instance, tends to increase with size for animals of the same species, but to decrease with size for animals of different species. This is because the parameter values are constants within a species, but vary in a size dependent manner for animals of different species. Although growth at constant food density is assumed to be of the von Bertalanffy type, and routine metabolism to be proportional to size, respiration turns out to be about proportional to size to the power 3/4, both within and between species. The value of about 3/4 has frequently been found, but it has always been thought to be incompatible with von Bertalanffy growth. {\textcopyright} 1986 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.},

abstract = {The influence of a lower condition on reproductive investment, somatic energy losses, and postspawning condition of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was examined under the hypothesis that females, in response to lower available energy reserves, would reduce reproductive investment in order to limit somatic energy losses. Laboratory experiments revealed that female cod with high prespawning condition factors ended reproduction in better condition than females with low prespawning condition factors. Fecundity and total egg dry weight were significantly lower in poor-condition females. The loss in somatic mass and energy in these poor-condition females was nevertheless higher, in relative terms, than the losses experienced by females in good condition. Consequently, energy reserves invested in reproduction by poor-condition females increase their risk of mortality. In the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence during the early 1990s, reproductive females had lower fecundities and were in worse prespawning and postspawning condition. The condition of spent females suggested a greater impact of changes in environmental conditions on adult than on immature cod. Reproductive potential and possibly recruitment may have suffered from that situation and could have contributed to the failure of that stock to recover despite the moratorium on commercial fishing.},

@article{Parker2018,
abstract = {Sedentary broadcast-spawning marine invertebrates, which release both eggs and sperm into the water for fertilization, are of special interest for sexual selection studies. They provide unique insight into the early stages of the evolutionary succession leading to the often-intense operation of both pre- and post-mating sexual selection in mobile gonochorists. Since they are sessile or only weakly mobile, adults can interact only to a limited extent with other adults and with their own fertilized offspring. They are consequently subject mainly to selection on gamete production and gamete success, and so high gonad expenditure is expected in both sexes. We review literature on gonadosomatic index (GSI; the proportion of body tissue devoted to gamete production) of gonochoristic broadcast spawners, which we use as a proxy for gonad expenditure. We show that such taxa most often have a high GSI that is approximately equal in both sexes. When GSI is asymmetric, female GSI usually exceeds male GSI, at least in echinoderms (the majority of species recorded). Intriguingly, though, higher male GSI also occurs in some species and appears more common than female-biased GSI in certain orders of gastropod molluscs. Our limited data also suggest that higher male GSI may be the prevalent pattern in sperm casters (where only males release gametes). We explore how selection might have shaped these patterns using game theoretic models for gonad expenditure that consider possible trade-offs with (i) somatic maintenance or (ii) growth, while also considering sperm competition, sperm limitation, and polyspermy. Our models of the trade-off between somatic tissue (which increases survival) and gonad (which increases reproductive success) predict that GSI should be equal for the two sexes when sperm competition is intense, as is probably common in broadcast spawners due to synchronous spawning in aggregations. Higher female GSI occurs under low sperm competition. Sperm limitation appears unlikely to alter these conclusions qualitatively, but can also act as a force to keep male GSI high, and close to that of females. Polyspermy can act to reduce male GSI. Higher male than female GSI is predicted to be less common (as observed in the data), but can occur when ova/ovaries are sufficiently more resource-intensive to produce than sperm/testes, for which some evidence exists. We also show that sex-specific trade-offs between gonads and growth can generate different life-history strategies for males and females, with males beginning reproduction earlier. This could lead to apparently higher male GSI in empirical studies if immature females are included in calculations of mean GSI. The existence of higher male GSI nonetheless remains somewhat problematic and requires further investigation. When sperm limitation is low, we suggest that the natural logarithm of the male/female GSI ratio may be a suitable index for sperm competition level in broadcast spawners, and that this may also be considered as an index for internally fertilizing taxa.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of three levels of dietary intake [ad libitum fed (AL), moderately severe (MSR), and severe restriction (SR)] and two levels of exercise [cage confinement (CC) and exercise training (E)] on 23-h resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body composition in 47 female Sprague-Dawley rats. At the end of the 9-wk study, the MSR and SR groups weighed {\~{}}81 and 61{\%}, respectively, of the AL-CC group. RMR was depressed for the MSR and SR groups compared with the AL-CC group. This was true whether expressed on an absolute (ml/min) or relative (ml{\textperiodcentered} min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-0.75) basis. On a relative basis, which accounts for changes caused by weight loss alone, the RMR decreased by {\~{}}12 and 19{\%}, respectively, for the MSR and SR groups compared with the AL-CC group. Although E resulted in significant differences in fat mass, percent fat, percent water, and heart mass between the AL groups, there were no significant differences between E and CC groups at either the MSR or SR level of dietary intake for any of the variables measured (i.e., body composition, muscle mass, RMR). Thus E does not appear to affect the composition of lost weight or RMR during diet-induced weight loss for female rats of normal weight.},

@article{Ritchie2018,
abstract = {Ubiquitous declines in biochemical reaction rates above optimal temperatures (Topt) are normally attributed to enzyme state changes, but such mechanisms appear inadequate to explain pervasive Topt well below enzyme deactivation temperatures (Tden). Here, a meta-analysis of 92 experimental studies shows that product formation responds twice as strongly to increased temperature than diffusion or transport. This response difference has multiple consequences for biochemical reactions, such as potential shifts in the factors limiting reactions as temperature increases and reaction-diffusion dynamics that predict potential product inhibition and limitation of the reaction by entropy production at temperatures below Tden. Maximizing entropy production by the reaction predicts Topt that depend on enzyme concentration and efficiency as well as reaction favorability, which are patterns not predicted by mechanisms of enzyme state change. However, these predictions are strongly supported by patterns in a meta-analysis of 121 enzyme kinetic studies. Consequently, reaction-diffusion thermodynamics and entropy production may constrain organism performance at higher temperatures, yielding temperature optima of life that may depend on reaction characteristics and environmental features rather than just enzyme state changes.},

Viviparity was associated with reduced reproductive effort, reduced age at maturity, and low M relative to oviparous species of a corresponding size. The allometric relationships of $\alpha$, M, and GSI with L∞ showed a high degree of scatter but were in agreement with predictions from models based on metabolic and ecological constraints on assimilation rate. In addition, however, residuals around the GSI-L∞ and M-L∞ relationships showed a strong positive correlation (r2 = 0.64), consistent with previous intraspecific manipulation experiments that indicated that reproductive effort and M are genetically linked. A strong positive correlation (r2 = 0.75) was found between GSI and M, and this relationship did not differ significantly between oviparous and viviparous species.},

abstract = {The standard Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model assumes that a fraction $\kappa$ of mobilised reserve is allocated to somatic maintenance plus growth, while the rest is allocated to maturity maintenance plus maturation (in embryos and juveniles) or reproduction (in adults). All DEB parameters have been estimated for 276 animal species from most large phyla and all chordate classes. The goodness of fit is generally excellent. We compared the estimated values of $\kappa$ with those that would maximise reproduction in fully grown adults with abundant food. Only 13{\%} of these species show a reproduction rate close to the maximum possible (assuming that $\kappa$ can be controlled), another 4{\%} have $\kappa$ lower than the optimal value, and 83{\%} have $\kappa$ higher than the optimal value. Strong empirical support hence exists for the conclusion that reproduction is generally not maximised. We also compared the parameters of the wild chicken with those of races selected for meat and egg production and found that the latter indeed maximise reproduction in terms of $\kappa$, while surface-specific assimilation was not affected by selection. We suggest that small values of $\kappa$ relate to the down-regulation of maximum body size, and large values to the down-regulation of reproduction. We briefly discuss the ecological context for these findings.},

abstract = {Energy flow and nutrient cycling dictate the functional role of organisms in ecosystems. Fishes are key vectors of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in aquatic systems, and the quantification of elemental fluxes is often achieved by coupling bioenergetics and stoichiometry. While nutrient limitation has been accounted for in several stoichiometric models, there is no current implementation that permits its incorporation into a bioenergetics approach to predict ingestion rates. This may lead to biased estimates of elemental fluxes. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that combines stoichiometry and bioenergetics with explicit consideration of elemental limitations. We examine varying elemental limitations across different trophic groups and life stages through a case study of three trophically distinct reef fishes. Further, we empirically validate our model using an independent database of measured excretion rates. Our model adequately predicts elemental fluxes in the examined species and reveals species- and size-specific limitations of C, N and P. In line with theoretical predictions, we demonstrate that the herbivore Zebrasoma scopas is limited by N and P, and all three fish species are limited by P in early life stages. Further, we show that failing to account for nutrient limitation can result in a greater than twofold underestimation of ingestion rates, which leads to severely biased excretion rates. Our model improved predictions of ingestion, excretion and egestion rates across all life stages, especially for fishes with diets low in N and/or P. Due to its broad applicability, its reliance on many parameters that are well-defined and widely accessible, and its straightforward implementation via the accompanying r-package fishflux, our model provides a user-friendly path towards a better understanding of ecosystem-wide nutrient cycling in the aquatic biome.
