I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Samraat Pawar as well as fellow lab members Tom Clegg and Olivia Moris for giving me so much of their time on weekly, and on occasion more than weekly, basis.  I would also like to thank Dr. Diego Barneche for his invaluable feedback and Dr. Van Savage for his assistance with some of the initial model development.
