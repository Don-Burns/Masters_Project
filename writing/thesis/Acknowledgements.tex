I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Samraat Pawar as well as fellow lab members Tom Clegg and Olivia Moris for giving me so much of their time on a weekly, and on occasion more than weekly, basis.  I would also like to thank Dr. Diego Barneche for his invaluable feedback and Dr. Van Savage for his assistance with some of the initial model development.

I would also like to thank my family and friends for listening to me waffle about my work like a madman thus keeping me sane in the crazy year that has been 2020.
