\section{Introduction}
	\linenumbers
	
	Growth is in essence a balancing act between how much energy an organism can acquire and the amount of energy required for maintenance, that is movement, digestion et cetera.  
	
	%	introduce west 2001 \cite{West2001}
	%	
	%	improved by hou et al \cite{Hou2008} talk about including SDA
	%	
	%	move to including reproduction with \cite{Charnov2001}
	
	Key to the above models is that many physical rates %find better word
	scale with mass to some power, known as power laws.  That is some rate $Y$ can be expressed for any mass by $Y = Y_0 m^\beta$.  
	
	% Discuss allometry and isometry here to highlight what scaling super or sub linearly means
	
	In classic OGMs this is most notable in determining how much energy an organism acquires at a given mass where gain = constant $\times$ mass$^{0.75}$.  This scaling is based on the work of \cite{West1997} \cite{Allen2005}
	
	
\subsection{section layout (old)}
	What is an OGM and ontogenic growth?
	
	An ontogenetic model or OGM is a model which describes the development of an organism.  Within a metabolic framework this describes how an organism's assess to and and alocation of energy changes throughout its lifetime.
	
	explain west's model
	
	explain terms 
	
	why is `a` resting metabolic rate?
	
	explain charnov's contribution
	
	- graph with generic example of the plot for illustration purposes
	
	explain what I am adding to `cm` and why --> maybe leave for the methods?
	
	talk about barneche 2018
	
	raises question of scaling elsewhere 
	
	talk about samraats work and how I plan to use it
	
	the goal of my paper
