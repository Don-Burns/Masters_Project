# Masters Thesis
My masters thesis for the 2019/2020 academic year as part of the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution at Imperial College London.

The project looks at ontogenetic models (OGMs) and using them to explore hyper-allomentric scaling in fish reproduction and how this may possibly relate to previously found hyper-allomentric scaling in consumption rate of consumers in 3D space.

## Getting started

Once the repository has been cloned locally, all code to run the project can be found in the `code` directory and an explanation of each code found in the README there


## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
